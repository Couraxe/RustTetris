# Rust Tetris

This app aims to be a complete low level Tetris clone written in Rust and SDL2. It should have
Scoring and game play similar to the NES version of the game.

## Getting Started

Currently only Ubuntu is supported, but it should be fairly 
easy to port to other platforms. See the Rust Cargo package for sdl to get windows instructions.

### Prerequisites

You will need the latest stable version of rust. You will also need sdl2 development libraries. which you can install with.

```
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
```

### Installing

To build and run the project, cd into the src directory and type 

```
cargo run
```

Cargo will go out and gather the needed dependencies, build and launch tetris.


## Built With

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) - Programming Language
* [Rust SDL](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2) - The Graphics Library wrapper written in rust
* [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) - C library rust wrapper uses
